What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that was being solved was that ABC university requested a program that would store, print and search for specified data from a comma separted value file. ABCU wanted the program would parse and check the CSV file in a data structure that would be appropriated for the task, print all of the stored courses and search for along with print a specified course along with its prerequisites. 


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The problem that ABCU wanted to solve was a completed incrementally. Pseudocode was first created then a worst case runtime, next a memory analysis of the pseudocode was performed. Finally the project was implemented and tested. It was important to choose the correct data structure to store courses or else it would result in a slower sorting/searching and printing time and potentially large memory usage. 



How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had some road blocks with getting the program to actually start, I had to do research to see that I forgot to include string so that part of my code could be implemented.  


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by forcing me to slow down and look over my code carefully as a lot of my mistakes were because of me overlooking and forgetting to add something in, in order for the code to work. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project was good practice for me as I did a lot of research during my testing period and had a good number of moments of trail and error. Enough to make a lot of my mistakes stick with me for future reference. Hash table and Binary search tree was also a good section where my mistakes took place, it made good for good practice.
